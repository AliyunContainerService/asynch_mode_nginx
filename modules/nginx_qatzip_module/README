This module is developed for accelerating GZIP compression with QATzip in Nginx
dynamic module framework.

Installation

1. Add below configuration line into the config.example
    --add-dynamic-module=modules/nginx_qatzip_module
2. Build Nginx with the addon modules
    $ ./config.example
    $ make && make install


Configuration

1. Add dynamic loading configuration in nginx.conf
    $ load_module modules/ngx_http_qatzip_filter_module.so;


Directives

    Syntax:     qatzip_sw only | failover | no;
    Default:    qatzip_sw failover;
    Context:    http, server, location, if in location
    Description:
                only,  QATzip is disabled.
                failover, QATzip is enabled with software fallback feature.
                no, QATzip is enabled without software fallback feature.

    Syntax:     qatzip_chunk_size size;
    Default:    qatzip_chunk_size 64k;
    Context:    http, server, location
    Description:
                Sets the chunk buffer size in which data will be compressed into
                one deflate block. The buffer size is limited, can be set to any
                value between 16K ~ 128K, by default, it is 64K.

    Syntax:     qatzip_stream_size size;
    Default:    qatzip_stream_size 256k;
    Context:    http, server, location
    Description:
                Sets the size of stream buffers in which data will be compressed into
                multiple deflate blocks and only the last block has FINAL bit being set.
                By default, the stream buffer size is 256K.

    Syntax:     qatzip_sw_threshold size;
    Default:    qatzip_sw_threshold 1k;
    Context:    http, server, location
    Description:
                Sets threshold of switching between software compression and QATzip
                compression. When response data size shorter than that, the software
                compression method will be used. By default, the threshold is 1K.

    Syntax:     qatzip_min_length length;
    Default:    qatzip_min_length 20;
    Context:    http, server, location
    Description:
                Sets the minimum length of a response that will be qatzipped.
                The length is determined only from the “Content-Length”
                response header field.

    Syntax:     qatzip_comp_level level;
    Default:    qatzip_comp_level 1;
    Context:    http, server, location
    Description:
                Sets a qatzip compression level of a response.
                Acceptable values are in the range from 1 to 9.

    Syntax:     qatzip_buffers number size;
    Default:    qatzip_buffers 32 4k|16 8k;
    Context:    http, server, location
    Description:
                Sets the number and size of buffers used to compress a response.
                By default, the buffer size is equal to one memory page.
                This is either 4K or 8K, depending on a platform.
